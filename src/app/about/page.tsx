      <p className="mb-2">
        Literature Mill is an independent, creator-first platform designed to help writers share, sell, and showcase their work â€” whether itâ€™s a short story, novel, research paper, or idea-in-progress.<br></br><br></br>

Built for small-scale authors and ambitious storytellers, we provide the tools to publish, reach readers, and earn fairly. No gatekeepers. No complex publishing contracts. Just your work, your audience, and your terms.<br></br><br></br>

On Literature Mill, authors keep 85% of their revenue, and every upload â€” whether free or paid â€” is backed by a simple, transparent system. We use Supabase and Stripe to handle secure authentication, storage, and payments, while keeping everything user-friendly and fast.<br></br><br></br>

Weâ€™re currently in pre-launch mode, actively developing new features like rich text editing, file uploads (PDF, DOCX), user dashboards, social interactions, and more.<br></br><br></br>
